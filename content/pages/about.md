      Employee turnover has been identified as a key issue for organizations
      because of its adverse impact on work place productivity and long term
      growth strategies. To solve this problem, organizations use machine
      learning techniques to predict employee turnover.  Accurate predictions
      enable organizations to take action for retention or succession planning
      of employees.

        However, the data for this modeling problem comes from HR Information
        Systems (HRIS); these are typically under-funded compared to the
        Information Systems ofother domains inthe organization which are
        directly related to its priorities. This leads to the prevalence of
        noise in the data that renders predictive models prone to
        over-fitting and hence inaccurate.

        AI doesn’t have to be scary. In fact, AI increasingly can help
        employers retain talent and prevent employee turnover.

        The key to effective use of AI for retention is combining big data and
        machine learning with the human touch.
